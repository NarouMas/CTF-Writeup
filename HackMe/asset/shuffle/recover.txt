However, the studio encountered difficulty with The Snow (OQ)ueen, as it could not find a way to adapt and relate the Snow (OQ)ueen character to modern audiences. (EMW)ven as far back as the 1930s and 1940s, it was clear that the source material contained great cinematic possibilities, but the Snow (OQ)ueen character proved to be too problematic.

"Disney had already done the 'kissed by a prince' thing, so ([])I([]) thought it was time for something new," he recalled.([])45([]) It turned out Lasseter had been interested in The Snow (OQ)ueen for a long time; back when (Pq)ixar was working with Disney on Toy Story in the 1990s, he saw and was "blown away" by some of the pre-production art from Disney's prior attempts.([])38([])(:j)6 Development began under the title Anna and the Snow (OQ)ueen, which was planned to be traditionally animated.([])46([]) According to Josh Gad, he first became involved with the film at that early stage, when the plot was still relatively close to the original Andersen fairy tale and (EMW)egan (EMW)ullally was going to play (EMW)lsa.([])47([]) By early 2010, the pro(:j)ect entered development hell once again, when the studio again failed to find a way to make the story and the Snow (OQ)ueen character work.([])48([])([])49([])??Revitalization([])edit([])?(OQ)n December 22, 2011, following the success of Tangled, Disney announced a new title for the film, Frozen, and a release date of November 27, 2013.([])50([]) A month later, it was confirmed that the film would be a computer-animated feature in stereoscopic 3D, instead of the originally intended hand-drawn animation.([])37([]) Anderson-Lopez and Lopez (:j)oined the pro(:j)ect and started writing songs for Frozen in January 2012.([])51([])(:j)44(:j)00 (OQ)n (EMW)arch 5, 2012, it was announced that Buck would be directing, with Lasseter and (Pq)eter Del Vecho producing.([])52([])??After Disney decided to advance The Snow (OQ)ueen into development again, one of the main challenges Buck and Del Vecho faced was the character of the Snow (OQ)ueen, who was then a villain in their drafts.([])39([]) The studio has a tradition of screening animated films in development every twelve weeks, then holding lengthy "notes sessions" in which its directors and screenwriters from different pro(:j)ects provide extensive "notes" on each other's work.([])53([])([])54([])([])55([])??Buck and Del Vecho presented their storyboards to Lasseter, and the entire production team ad(:j)ourned to a conference to hear his thoughts on the pro(:j)ect.([])39([]) Art director (EMW)ichael Giaimo later acknowledged Lasseter as the "game changer" of the film(:j) "I remember John saying that the latest version of The Snow (OQ)ueen story that Chris Buck and his team had come up with was fun, very light-hearted. But the characters didn't resonate. They aren't multi-faceted. (EMW)hich is why John felt that audiences wouldn't really be able to connect with them."([])39([])??The production team then addressed the film's problems, drafting several variations on The Snow (OQ)ueen story until the characters and story felt relevant. At that stage, the first ma(:j)or breakthrough was the decision to rewrite the film's protagonist, Anna (())who was based on the Gerda character from The Snow (OQ)ueen(()), as the younger sibling of (EMW)lsa, thereby effectively establishing a family dynamic between the characters.([])39([])([])56([])([])57([]) This was unusual in that relationships between sisters are rarely used as a ma(:j)or plot element in American animated films, with the notable exception of Disney's Lilo  Stitch (())2002(()).([])38([])(:j)13 To fully explore the uni(Pq)ue dynamics of such relationships, Disney Animation convened a "Sister Summit," at which women from all over the studio who grew up with sisters were asked to discuss their relationships with their sisters.([])38([])(:j)14??(EMW)riting([])edit([])?In (EMW)arch 2012, Jennifer Lee, one of the screenwriters of (EMW)reck-It Ralph, was brought in as the film's screenwriter by Del Vecho.([])58([])([])59([]) Lee later explained that as (EMW)reck-It Ralph was wrapping up, she was giving notes on other pro(:j)ects, and "we kind of really connected with what we were thinking."([])60([])??According to Lee, several core concepts were already in place from Buck and Del Vecho's early work, such as the film's "frozen heart" hook(:j) "That was a concept and the phrase ... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart."([])60([]) They already knew the ending involved true love in the sense of the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that "Anna was going to save (EMW)lsa. (EMW)e didnt know how or why."([])60([]) Lee said (EMW)dwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, told her early on about the film's ending(:j) "First and foremost, no matter what you have to do to the story, do it. But you have to earn that ending. If you do([]),([]) it will be great. If you don't, it will suck."([])53([])??Before Lee was brought on board, another screenwriter had made a first pass at a script, and Anderson-Lopez and Lopez tried to write songs for that script but none worked and all were cut.([])51([])(:j)9(:j)07 Then "the whole script imploded," which gave the songwriters the opportunity "to put a lot of ([])their([]) DNA" into the new script that Lee was writing.([])51([])(:j)30(:j)32 The production team "essentially started over and ... had 17 months," which resulted in a very "intense schedule" and implied "a lot of choices had to be made fast."([])60([])??The earlier versions differed sharply from the final version. In the original script the songwriters first saw, (EMW)lsa was evil from the start; she kidnapped Anna from her own wedding to intentionally freeze her heart, then later descended upon the town with an army of snowmen with the ob(:j)ective of recapturing Anna to freeze her heart properly.([])51([])(:j)8(:j)42 By the time Lee came in, the first act included (EMW)lsa deliberately striking Anna in the heart with her freezing powers; then "the whole second act was about Anna trying to get to Hans and to kiss him and then (EMW)lsa trying to stop her."([])60([]) Buck revealed that the original plot attempted to make Anna sympathetic by focusing on her frustration as being perceived as the "spare" in relation to the "heir," (EMW)lsa.([])61([]) The original plot also had different pacing, in that it was "much more of an action adventure" than a musical or a comedy.([])58([])??(OQ)ne ma(:j)or breakthrough was the composition of the song "Let It Go" by songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez, which forced the production team to reconceptualize and rewrite (EMW)lsa as a far more complex, vulnerable, and sympathetic character.([])56([]) In The Daily Telegraph's words, instead of the villain envisioned by the producers, the songwriters saw (EMW)lsa as "a scared girl struggling to control and come to terms with her gift."([])62([]) Lee recalled(:j) "Bobby and Kristen said they were walking in (Pq)rospect (Pq)ark and they (:j)ust started talking about what would it feel like ([])to be (EMW)lsa([]). Forget villain. Just what it would feel like. And this concept of letting out who she is([]),([]) that she's kept to herself for so long([]),([]) and she's alone and free, but then the sadness of the fact ([])sic([]) that the last moment is she's alone. Its not a perfect thing, but it's powerful."([])60([]) Del Vecho explained that "Let It Go" changed (EMW)lsa into a person "ruled by fear and Anna was ruled by her own love of other people and her own drive," which in turn caused Lee to "rewrite the first act and then that rippled through the entire movie. So that was when we really found the movie and who these characters were."([])55([])??Another ma(:j)or breakthrough was developing the plot twist that (Pq)rince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end.([])55([]) Hans was not even in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot.([])55([]) Del Vecho said, "(EMW)e realized ([])what([]) was most important ([])was([]) if we were going to make the ending so surprising([]),([]) you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer ... ([])when([]) he's not the answer, it's Kristoff ... ([])I([])f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out([]),([]) you can surprise them by turning it the other way."([])55([]) Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as "sociopathic" and "twisted" throughout the final version.([])60([]) For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters(:j) "He mirrors ([])Anna([]) and he's goofy with her ... ([])T([])he Duke ([])of (EMW)eselton([]) is a (:j)erk, so he's a (:j)erk back. And with (EMW)lsa he's a hero."([])60([]) It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to "feel ... her feeling something but not (Pq)uite understanding it ... Because the minute it is ([])understood,([]) it deflated."([])60([]) At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after (EMW)alt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.([])63([])??Lee had to work through the issue of how to write Anna's personality, in that some of her colleagues felt Anna should be more dysfunctional and co-dependent, like Vanellope von Schweetz in (EMW)reck-It Ralph.([])58([]) Lee disagreed with that position, but it took her almost a year to figure out how to convincingly articulate "this is what Anna's (:j)ourney is. No more than that. No less than that."([])60([]) In the end, Lee successfully argued Anna's (:j)ourney should be presented as a simple coming-of-age story, "where she goes from having a naive view of life and love  because she's lonely  to the most sophisticated and mature view of love, where she's capable of the ultimate love, which is sacrifice."([])58([]) Lee also had to let go of some ideas that she liked, such as a scene portraying Anna and (EMW)lsa's relationship as teenagers, which did not work because they needed to maintain the separation between Anna and (EMW)lsa.([])58([])??To construct Anna and (EMW)lsa's relationship as sisters, Lee found inspiration in her own relationship with her older sister.([])60([])([])64([]) Lee said her older sister was "a big inspiration for (EMW)lsa,"([])60([]) called her "my (EMW)lsa" in an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times, and walked the red carpet with her at the 86th Academy Awards.([])54([]) Lee explained, "([])h([])aving to ... lose each other and then rediscover each other as adults, that was a big part of my life."([])60([])??The production team also turned (OQ)laf from (EMW)lsa's obnoxious sidekick into Anna's comically innocent sidekick.([])60([]) Lee's initial response to the original "mean" version of (OQ)laf had been, "Kill the f-ing snowman," and she found (OQ)laf by far "the hardest character to deal with."([])60([])??The problem of how exactly Anna would save (EMW)lsa at the film's climax was solved by story artist John Ripa. At the story meeting where Ripa pitched his take on the story, the response was silence until Lasseter said, "I've never seen anything like that before," which was followed by a standing ovation.([])38([])(:j)31??Along the way, the production team went through drafts where the first act included far more detail than what ended up in the final version, such as a troll with a Brooklyn accent who would have explained the backstory behind (EMW)lsa's magical powers, and a regent for whom Lee was hoping to cast comedian Louis C.K.([])60([]) After all those details were thoroughly "over-analyzed", they were excised because they amounted to a "much more complex story than really we felt like we could fit in this 90-minute film."([])60([]) As Del Vecho put it, "the more we tried to explain things at the beginning, the more complicated it got."([])65([])??Following Lee's extensive involvement in Frozen's development process and her close work with director Buck and songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez,([])40([]) studio heads Lasseter and Catmull promoted her to director of the film alongside Buck in August 2012.([])53([])([])66([]) Her promotion was officially announced on November 29, 2012,([])67([]) making Lee the first woman to direct a full-length animated motion picture produced by (EMW)alt Disney Animation Studios.([])56([]) She primarily worked on story while Buck focused on animation.([])40([])([])55([]) Lee later stated that she was "really moved by a lot of what Chris had done" and that they "shared a vision" of the story, having "very similar sensibilities".([])53([])??By November 2012, the production team thought they had finally "cracked" the puzzle of how to make the film's story work,([])38([])(:j)155 but according to Del Vecho, in late February 2013, it was realized that the film still "wasn't working", which necessitated even more rewriting of scenes and songs from February through June 2013.([])65([])([])68([])([])69([]) He explained, "we rewrote songs, we took out characters and changed everything, and suddenly the movie gelled. But that was close. In hindsight, piece of cake, but during, it was a big struggle."([])65([]) Looking back, Anderson-Lopez (:j)oked she and Lopez thought at the time they could end up working as "birthday party clown([])s([])" if the final product "pull([])ed([]) ... down" their careers([])51([])(:j)19(:j)07 and recalled that "we were really writing up until the last minute."([])70([]) In June (())five months before the already-announced release date(()), the songwriters finally got the film working when they composed the song "For the First Time in Forever", which, in Lopez's words, "became the linchpin of the whole movie."([])51([])(:j)19(:j)24??That month, Disney conducted test screenings of the half-completed film with two audiences (())one made up of families and the other made up of adults(())([])68([]) in (Pq)hoenix, Arizona,([])64([]) at which Lasseter and Catmull were personally present.([])60([])([])71([]) Lee recalled that it was the moment when they realized they "had something, because the reaction was huge."([])71([]) Catmull, who had instructed Lee at the outset to "earn that ending," told her afterwards, "you did it".([])60([])??Casting([])edit([])?Actress Kristen Bell was cast as the voice of Anna on (EMW)arch 5, 2012.([])26([])([])52([]) Lee admitted that Bell's casting selection was influenced after the filmmakers listened to a series of vocal tracks Bell had recorded when she was young, where the actress performed several songs from The Little (EMW)ermaid, including "(Pq)art of Your (EMW)orld".([])72([]) Bell completed her recording sessions while she was pregnant, and subse(Pq)uently re-recorded some of her character's lines after her pregnancy, as her voice had deepened.([])73([]) Bell was called in to re-record dialogue for the film "probably 20 times," which is normal for lead roles in Disney animated films whose scripts are still evolving.([])74([]) As for her approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" since she was four years old,([])26([]) saying, "I always loved Disney animation, but there was something about the females that was unattainable to me. Their posture was too good and they were too well-spoken, and I feel like I really made this girl much more relatable and weirder and scrappier and more excitable and awkward. I'm really proud of that."([])75([])??Frozen is "a bit of a feminist movie for Disney. I'm really proud of that. It has everything, but it's essentially about sisterhood.

"I actually film myself acting the scene out, which I find very helpful," said animation supervisor Rebecca (EMW)ilson Bresee. This helped her discover elements that made the scene feel real and believable.([])87([]) (EMW)lsa's supervising animator was (EMW)ayne Unten, who asked for that role because he was fascinated by the complexity of the character.([])88([]) Unten carefully developed (EMW)lsa's facial expressions in order to bring out her fear as contrasted against Anna's fearlessness.([])88([]) He also studied videos from (EMW)enzel's recording sessions and animated (EMW)lsa's breathing to match (EMW)enzel's breathing.([])82([]) Head of Animation, Lino DiSalvo, said, "The goal for the film was to animate the most believable CG characters you've ever seen." ([])89([])??Regarding the look and nature of the film's cinematography, Giaimo was greatly influenced by Jack Cardiff's work in Black Narcissus. According to him, it lent a hyper-reality to the film(:j) "Because this is a movie with such scale and we have the Norwegian f(:j)ords to draw from, I really wanted to explore the depth. From a design perspective, since I was stressing the horizontal and vertical aspects, and what the f(:j)ords provide, it was perfect. (EMW)e encased the sibling story in scale." Ted D. (EMW)cCord's work in The Sound of (EMW)usic was another ma(:j)or influence for Giaimo. It was also Giaimo's idea that Frozen should be filmed in the CinemaScope aspect ratio, which was approved by Lasseter.([])86([]) Giaimo also wanted to ensure that Norway's f(:j)ords, architecture and rosemaling folk art, were critical factors in designing the environment of Arendelle. Giaimo, whose background is in traditional animation, said that the art design environment represents a unity of character and environment and that he originally wanted to incorporate saturated colors, which is typically ill-advised in computer animation.([])86([]) For further authenticity, a live reindeer named Sage was brought into the studio for animators to study its movements and mannerisms for the character Sven.([])90([])([])91([])??Another important issue Giaimo insisted on addressing was costumes, in that he "knew from the start" it would be a "costume film."([])38([])(:j)77 To realize that vision, he brought in character designer Jean Gillmore to act as a dedicated "costume designer".([])92([]) (EMW)hile traditional animation simply integrates costume design with character design and treats clothing as merely part of the characters, computer-generated animation regards costume as almost a separate entity with its own properties and behaviors([])92([]) - and Frozen re(Pq)uired a level of as-yet untried detail, down to minutiae like fabrics, buttons, trim, and stitching.([])38([])(:j)76 Gillmore explained that her "general approach was to meld the historic silhouettes of 1840 (EMW)estern (EMW)urope (())give or take(()), with the shapes and garment relationships and details of folk costume in early Norway, circa 19th century."([])92([]) This meant using primarily wool fabric with accents of velvet, linen, and silk.([])38([])(:j)75 During production, Giaimo and Gillmore "ran around" supplying various departments with real-world samples to use as references; they were able to draw upon both the studio's own in-house library of fabric samples and the resources of (EMW)alt Disney (Pq)arks and Resorts' costume division in Fullerton, California.([])92([]) The film's "look development artists" (())the Disney (:j)ob title for texture artists([])93([])(:j)58-59(()) created the digitally painted simulation of the appearance of surfaces, while other departments dealt with movement, rigging and weight, thickness and lighting of textile animation.([])92([])??During production, the film's (EMW)nglish title was changed from The Snow (OQ)ueen to Frozen, a decision that drew comparisons to another Disney film, Tangled. (Pq)eter Del Vecho explained that "the title Frozen came up independently of the title Tangled. It's because, to us, it represents the movie. Frozen plays on the level of ice and snow but also the frozen relationship, the frozen heart that has to be thawed. (EMW)e don't think of comparisons between Tangled and Frozen, though." He also mentioned that the film will still retain its original title, The Snow (OQ)ueen, in some countries(:j) "because that (:j)ust resonated stronger in some countries than Frozen. (EMW)aybe there's a richness to The Snow (OQ)ueen in the country's heritage and they (:j)ust wanted to emphasize that."([])40([])??Technology development([])edit([])??Test animation demonstrating snow effects employed in the film?The studio also developed several new tools to generate realistic and believable shots, particularly the heavy and deep snow and its interactions with the characters. Disney wanted an "all-encompassing" and organic tool to provide snow effects but not re(Pq)uire switching between different methods.([])94([]) As noted above, several Disney artists and special effects personnel traveled to (EMW)yoming to experience walking through deep snow.([])80([]) Dr. Kenneth Libbrecht, a professor from the California Institute of Technology, was invited to give lectures to the effects group on how snow and ice form, and why snowflakes are uni(Pq)ue.([])80([]) Using this knowledge, the effects group created a snowflake generator that allowed them to randomly create 2,000 uni(Pq)ue snowflake shapes for the film.([])87([])??Another challenge that the studio had to face was to deliver shots of heavy and deep snow that both interacted believably with characters and had a realistic sticky (Pq)uality.([])94([]) According to principal software engineer Andrew Selle, "([])Snow([])'s not really a fluid. It-s not really a solid. It breaks apart. It can be compressed into snowballs. All of these different effects are very difficult to capture simultaneously."([])80([]) In order to achieve this, software engineers used advanced mathematics (())the material point method(()) and physics, with assistance from mathematics researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles([])95([])([])96([]) to create a snow simulator software application called (EMW)atterhorn. The tool was capable of depicting realistic snow in a virtual environment and was used in at least 43 scenes in the film, including several key se(Pq)uences.([])56([])([])94([])([])95([])([])97([]) Software engineer Alexey Stomakhin referred to snow as "an important character in the film,"([])95([]) therefore it attracted special attention from the filmmakers.([])80([]) "(EMW)hen you stretch it, snow will break into chunks. Since snow doesn't have any connections, it doesn't have a mesh, it can break very easily. So that was an important property we took advantage of," explained Selle. "There you see ([])Kristoff([]) walking through and see his footprints breaking the snow into little pieces and chunk up and you see ([])Anna([]) being pulled out and the snow having packed together and broken into pieces. It's very organic how that happens. You don't see that they're pieces already - you see the snow as one thing and then breaking up."([])94([]) The tool also proved to be particularly useful in scenes involving characters walking through deep snow, as it ensured that the snow reacted naturally to each step.([])80([])??(OQ)ther tools designed to help artists complete complicated effects included Spaces, which allowed (OQ)laf's deconstructible parts to be moved around and rebuilt, Flourish, which allowed extra movement such as leaves and twigs to be art-directed; Snow Batcher, which helped preview the final look of the snow, especially when characters were interacting with an area of snow by walking through a volume, and Tonic, which enabled artists to sculpt their characters' hair as procedural volumes.([])94([]) Tonic also aided in animating fur and hair elements such as (EMW)lsa's hair, which contains 420,000 computer-generated strands, while the average number for a real human being is only 100,000.([])80([]) The number of character rigs in Frozen is 312 and the number of simulated costumes also reached 245 cloth rigs, which were far beyond all other Disney films to date.([])22([])([])87([]) Fifty effects artists and lighting artists worked together on the technology to create "one single shot" in which (EMW)lsa builds her ice palace. Its complexity re(Pq)uired 30 hours to render each frame, with 4,000 computers rendering one frame at a time.([])98([])([])99([])??Besides 3D effects, the filmmakers also used 2D artwork and drawings for specific elements and se(Pq)uences in the film, including (EMW)lsa's magic and snow sculptures, as well as freezing fountains and floors.([])94([])([])97([]) The effects group created a "capture stage" where the entire world of Frozen gets displayed on monitors, which can be "filmed" on special cameras to operate a three-dimensional scene. "(EMW)e can take this virtual set that's mimicking all of my actions and put it into any one of our scenes in the film," said technology manager (EMW)van Goldberg.([])87([])??Scandinavian and Sami inspiration([])edit([])?The setting was principally based on Norway, and the cultural influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture.([])100([]) Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film, including the Akershus Fortress in (OQ)slo, the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, and Bryggen in Bergen. Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are also included in the film, such as stave churches,([])100([]) trolls,([])18([])(:j)6 Viking ships, a hot spring, F(:j)ord horses,([])101([]) clothes,([])80([]) and food such as lutefisk.([])18([])(:j)43([])102([]) A maypole is also present in the film, as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that Anna and (EMW)lsa's father opens to figure out where the trolls live.([])18([])(:j)6 A scene where two men argue over whether to stack firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to the perennial Norwegian debate over how to stack firewood properly.([])18([])(:j)59([])103([]) The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sami culture, such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the e(Pq)uipment used to control these, clothing styles (())the outfits of the ice cutters(()), and parts of the musical score.([])104([])([])105([]) Decorations, such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff's sled, are also in styles inspired by Sami duod(:j)i decorations. During their field work in Norway, Disney's team, for inspiration, visited Rorosrein, a Sami family-owned company in the village (Pq)lass(:j)e that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events.([])106([]) Arendelle was inspired by Naroyf(:j)ord, a branch of Norway's longest f(:j)ord Sognef(:j)orden, which has been listed as a UN(EMW)SC(OQ) (EMW)orld Heritage Site;([])107([]) while a castle in (OQ)slo with beautiful hand-painted patterns on all four walls served as the inspiration for the kingdom's royal castle interior.([])108([])??The filmmakers' trip to Norway provided essential knowledge for the animators to come up with the design aesthetic for the film in terms of color, light, and atmosphere. According to Giaimo, there were three important factors that they had ac(Pq)uired from the Norway research trip(:j) the f(:j)ords, which are the massive vertical rock formations, and serve as the setting for the secluded kingdom of Arendelle; the medieval stave churches, whose rustic triangular rooflines and shingles inspired the castle compound; and the rosemaling folk art, whose distinctive paneling and grid patterns informed the architecture, decor, and costumes.([])86([])??(EMW)usic and sound design([])edit([])?(EMW)ain article(:j) Frozen (())soundtrack(())??Christophe Beck composed the film's score.?The songs for Frozen were written and composed by the husband-and-wife songwriting team of Robert Lopez and Kristen Anderson-Lopez, both of whom had previously worked with Disney Animation on (EMW)innie the (Pq)ooh (())2011(()) (())also produced by Del Vecho, who then hired them for Frozen([])68([])(()) and before that, with Disney (Pq)arks on Finding Nemo - The (EMW)usical (())2007(()).([])23([])([])109([])([])110([]) Lopez first heard Disney Animation's pitch while in Los Angeles working on The Book of (EMW)ormon, but Disney was so eager to get both of them on board that the production team traveled to New York City to also pitch the film in person to Anderson-Lopez (())who was busy raising the couple's two young daughters(()).([])111([]) Lopez believes Disney was particularly interested in his wife's strong story talent.([])112([]) The decision, of course, was easy(:j) "(EMW)henever Disney asks if you want to do a fairy tale musical, you say yes."([])112([])??About 23 minutes of the film are dedicated to their musical numbers.([])113([])([])114([]) Because they live in New York City, collaborating closely with the production team in Burbank re(Pq)uired two-hour-long transcontinental videoconferences nearly every weekday for about 14 months.([])83([])([])110([])([])115([])([])116([]) For each song they composed, they recorded a demo in their home studio (())with both of them singing the lyrics and Lopez accompanying on piano(()), then emailed it to Burbank for discussion at the next videoconference.([])117([]) Lopez and Anderson-Lopez were aware of the fact that their work would be compared to that of Alan (EMW)enken and Howard Ashman from the Disney Renaissance era, and whenever they felt lost, they asked "(EMW)hat would Ashman do"([])118([]) In the end, they wrote 25 songs for the film, of which eight made it into the final version.([])118([]) (OQ)ne song (())"For the First Time in Forever"(()) had a reprise and the other (())"Let It Go"(()) was covered by Demi Lovato over the final credits, for a total of ten songs. Seven of the 17 that did not make it were later released on the deluxe edition soundtrack.??In February 2013, Christophe Beck was hired to score the film, following his work on (Pq)aperman, a Disney animated short film released the year prior to Frozen.([])119([]) It was revealed on September 14, 2013, that Smi musician Frode F(:j)ellheim's (EMW)atnemen Vuelie would be the film's opening song, as it contains elements of the traditional Smi singing style (:j)oik.([])120([]) The music producers recruited a Norwegian linguist to assist with the lyrics for an (OQ)ld Norse song written for (EMW)lsa's coronation([])121([]) and traveled to Trondheim, Norway,([])118([]) to record the all-female choir Cantus, for a piece inspired by traditional Smi music.([])121([])??Under the supervision of sound engineer David Boucher, the lead cast members began recording the film's vocal tracks in (OQ)ctober 2012 at the Sunset Sound recording studio in Hollywood before the songs had been orchestrated, meaning they heard only Lopez's demo piano track in their headphones as they sang.([])122([]) (EMW)ost of the dialogue was recorded at the Roy (EMW). Disney Animation Building in Burbank under the supervision of original dialogue mixer Gabriel Guy, who also mixed the film's sound effects.([])74([]) Some dialogue was recorded after recording songs at both Sunset Sound and Capitol Studios; for scenes involving Anna and (EMW)lsa, both studios offered vocal isolation booths where (EMW)enzel and Bell could read dialogue with line-of-sight with one another, while avoiding "bleedthrough" between their respective tracks.([])74([]) Additional dialogue was recorded at an ADR facility on the (EMW)alt Disney Studios lot in Burbank (())across the street from the Disney Animation building(()) and at the Soundtrack Group's New York studio,([])74([]) since the production team had to work around the busy schedules of the film's New York-based cast members like Fontana.([])123([])??Lopez and Anderson-Lopez's piano-vocal scores for the songs along with the vocal tracks were sent to Salem, (OQ)regon-based Dave (EMW)etzger for arrangement and orchestration;([])122([])([])124([]) (EMW)etzger also orchestrated a significant portion of Beck's score.([])110([])??For the orchestral film score, Beck paid homage to the Norway- and Spmi-inspired setting by employing regional instruments, such as the bukkehorn, and traditional vocal techni(Pq)ues, such as kulning.([])121([]) Beck worked with Lopez and Anderson-Lopez on incorporating their songs into arrangements in the score. The trio's goal "was to create a cohesive musical (:j)ourney from beginning to end."([])121([]) Similarly, Beck's scoring mixer, Casey Stone (())who also supervised the recording of the score(()), worked with Boucher to align their microphone setups to ensure the transitions between the songs and score were seamless, even though they were separately recorded on different dates.([])122([]) The final orchestrations of both the songs and score were all recorded at the (EMW)astwood Scoring Stage([])122([])([])125([]) on the (EMW)arner Bros. studio lot in Burbank by an 80-piece orchestra, featuring 32 vocalists, including native Norwegian Christine Hals.([])121([]) Boucher supervised the recording of Anderson-Lopez and Lopez's songs from July 22 to 24, 2013, then Stone supervised the recording of Beck's score from September 3 to 6 and 9 to 10. Boucher mixed the songs at the (EMW)astwood stage, while Stone mixed the score at Beck's personal studio in Santa (EMW)onica, California.([])122([])??Regarding the sound of Frozen, director Jennifer Lee stated that sound played a huge part in making the film "visceral" and "transported"; she explained, "([])i([])n letting it tell the story emotionally, the sound of the ice when it's at its most dangerous (:j)ust makes you shudder."([])126([]) The complete silence at the climax of the film right after Anna freezes was Lasseter's idea, one he "really wanted".([])126([]) In that scene, even the ambient sound that would normally be there was taken out in order to make it feel unusual.([])126([]) Lee explained "that was a moment where we wanted everything to feel suspended."([])126([])??To obtain certain snow and ice sound effects, sound designer (OQ)din Benitez traveled to (EMW)ammoth (EMW)ountain, California, to record them at a frozen lake.([])83([]) However, the foley work for the film was recorded on the foley stage on the (EMW)arner Bros. lot by a (EMW)arner Bros. crew.([])74([])([])125([]) The foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds (())22.6 kg(()) of snow ice while working, to help them record all the necessary snow and ice sounds for the film.([])74([]) Because the film's visuals were finalized so late, five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded (())corresponding to five different types of snow(()), then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in the final version of each scene.([])74([]) (OQ)ne issue that the production team was "particular" about was the sound of (EMW)lsa's footsteps in the ice palace, which re(Pq)uired eight attempts, including wine glasses on ice and metal knives on ice; they ended up using a mix of three sounds.([])74([])??Although the vocals, music, sound effects, and almost all the dialogue were all recorded elsewhere, the final re-recording mix to Dolby Atmos format was performed at the Disney lot by Casey (EMW).
